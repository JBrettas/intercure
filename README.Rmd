[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JBrettas/intercure.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JBrettas/intercure)

The intercure package provides R implementations for different cure rate models to interval censored data. The goal is to estimate the effects of each given covariate using different specifications and computing the estimated cure fraction with it. For simulation and illustrative examples, the package also provides functions to generate a dataset using one of the cure rate specification. 

Two models for interval censored data are considered on this package: the bounded cumulative hazard model proposed on @shen2009; the frailty model proposed on @lam2013, with its extension to clustered data presented on @lam2014.

## Functions

To fit a cure rate model:
* inter_bch
* inter_frailty
* inter_frailty_cl

To generate datasets:
* sim_bch
* sim_frailty
* sim_frailty_cl
